# AcademicGrades_ShinyApp
Academic Grades Obtained Demonstration through a Shiny App. Based on the different grades obtained during the my Bachelor in Business Administration and Master of Science in Business Analytics, I created a simple Shiny app so that evolution, averages and distributions can be tracked across years of study, programs and honors grades. 

The Shiny App on the web is hosted using Shinyapps.io, and the link can be found here: https://wtys8e-adri0termes0berruga.shinyapps.io/Esade_Grades_Dashboard/
